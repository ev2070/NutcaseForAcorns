**Nutcase For Acorns** is a windy and slippery adventure where you step into the shoes of the acorn-obsessed Scrat. Inspired by the Ice Age franchise, this game captures the essence of Scrat's relentless pursuit of his coveted acorn, often filled with unexpected obstacles and comical setbacks.

With a clear vision in mind, this game features refined and intuitive gameplay, engaging visual and auditory elements, and thoughtfully designed levels that challenge players at every turn.
